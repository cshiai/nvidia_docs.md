# 5. Type System


All values and operations in Tile IR are statically typed. This section defines Tile IR’s types, as well as their equivalence, layouts, and other type system details that may be relevant for DSL and compiler authors.


Notably Tile IR is tensor valued: all values are tensors. We have two concrete tensor types: tile, a pure tensor value, and view, a structured pointer to a tensor in memory. Additionally, we use element types in the formulation of our type system. They do not describe a value on their own.


## 5.1. Element Types


Element types are the native data types supported by Tile IR. By themselves they do not describe a value. As Tile IR operates over tensors, these types describe the hardware accelerated, primitive values that can be contained by a tensor. They specify how a sequence of bits are to be interpreted. Each element type has a size associated with it that represents the number of bits required to represent it.


Note


Note that this is different from a potential storage size, which is specified by the data layout of the tensor which contains these values.


Element types come in two flavors, general purpose fundamental types that come without restriction, and specialized alternative types which each come with a set of restrictions.


### 5.1.1. Fundamental Types


Tile IR supports a set of general purpose integer and floating-point types that are supported by all operations and have no restrictions. These can be contained in arbitrary rank, and shape tensors, and 0-rank values of this type can be treated as scalars.


| Type | Sizes | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| i1, i8, i16, i32, i64 | 1, 8, 16, 32, 64 | signless integer type of specified size |
| f16, f32, f64 | 16, 32, 64 | IEEE floating-point type of specified size |


Primary elemental types are supported in all arithmetic operations.


Warning


Integer types are signless, i.e., the type does not encode whether the represented value is to be interpreted as a signed or unsigned value. For operations where this distinction is semantically meaningful signedness is controlled via flags on each arithmetic operation.


### 5.1.2. Alternative Types


Tile IR also supports a set of non-standard but hardware accelerated floating-point types. Due to the nature of these types and hardware they each come with a set of restrictions.


| Type | Size | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| tf32 | 32 | floating-point format with 8 bits for exponent and 10 bits for
mantissa. Storage size is 4 bytes with 4-byte alignment |
| bf16 | 16 | floating-point format with 8 bits for exponent and 7 bits for
mantissa |
| e3m4 | 8 | floating-point format with 3 bits for exponent and 4 bits for
mantissa |
| e5m2 | 8 | floating-point format with 5 bits for exponent and 2 bits for
mantissa |


Tensors of these types may be created, manipulated and loaded and stored from global memory, but certain computations on them are restricted.


## 5.2. Pointers


Pointers, or values which contain memory addresses, are typed as pointers to a specific pointee type.


| Type | Size | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ptr<E> | 64 | a pointer to a location in memory; the data at the location
represents a value of non-pointer element type E |


The pointer points to a location in memory. The data at that location will be interpreted as being of element type E when loaded.


Pointer arithmetic also assumes the storage size of the type `E` for offset computations. Pointer types are parameterized by element types (i.e., nested pointer types are not supported). For details about converting between different pointer types, or integers see [cuda_tile.bitcast](operations.html#op-cuda-tile-bitcast).


## 5.3. Tensor Types


A tensor is a multi-dimensional, rectangular array described by a shape and element type. The shape is a vector that describes the number of elements across each axis of the tensor. The length of said vector describes the rank of the tensor, i.e., the number of its dimensions. All tensors in Tile IR have a statically known rank. Tile IR has two kinds of tensor types tiles and views.


### 5.3.1. Tile Type


All values in Tile IR are of type tile. A tile is a tensor with static shape, i.e., the extent across each dimension is known at compile time. Each extent must be a power of two.


We use `tile<MxNxKxE>` where `M`, `N`, `K` are integer numbers and `E` is an element type as syntax for tile types, see [Syntax](syntax.html#section-syntax) for more details.


| Example Tile Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| tile<2x8xf32> | a 2-dimensional tensor with 2 rows and 8 columns of f32 values |
| tile<f32> | a single value of type f32 |
| tile<ptr<f32>> | a pointer to a value of type f32 |
| tile<4x8xptr<f32>> | a 2-dimensional tensor with 4 rows and 8 columns of pointers to
values of type f32 |


Note


The shape of a tensor of pointers defines the shape of the values that are loaded or stored. It does not imply any structure on the locations themselves. For example, two consecutive elements of the tensor may not be consecutive locations in memory. Even more, the same location may be present multiple times within a single tensor of pointers. See [Memory Model](memory_model.html#section-memory-model) for a discussion of implications.


### 5.3.2. Tensor View


It is common that data in global memory follows a strided structure. For example, the widely adopted row-major or column-major layouts are strided. It is beneficial for the compiler to be aware of the strided layout of data in memory. Tile IR features a tensor view type to describe such structure in global memory.


Conceptually, a tensor view type describes an abstracted tensor of pointers. Like a regular tensor, it is described by a shape and the type of elements it points to. It in addition has a vector of striding factors.


The striding factors describe the relative position of locations the elements of the tensor view point to. If an element is \(d\) elements apart in dimension \(i\) of the tensor view, the corresponding locations in memory will be \(d * stride_i\) elements away. This information can be used by the compiler to reason about access patterns and layouts of data in memory.


Values of type tensor view are typically never materialized in memory. Rather, they are stored as a compact description of a base-location, shape and striding factors. From this information, a tensor of pointers corresponding to the full view value can be computed using the following formula

  \[elem_{[i_0, ..., i_n]} = baseptr + \sum_{m=0}^{n} i_m * s_m\]
where the \(s_m\) are the striding factors of the tensor view and \(baseptr\) is the start address in global memory.


Other than the tile type, a tensor view supports dynamic extents in the shape vector. We use the `?` character to denote these. Dynamic extents are bound at runtime to values when the view type is constructed using a [cuda_tile.make_tensor_view](operations.html#op-cuda-tile-make-tensor-view) operation.


A dynamically shaped tensor view cannot be directly used to access memory. It first needs to be divided into tiles of static size.


A tensor view is constructed using the [cuda_tile.make_tensor_view](operations.html#op-cuda-tile-make-tensor-view) operation and consists of the components:


 - `elementType`, the type of the elements in the view
 - `shape`, an array of 64-bit integer describing the size of each dimension
 - `strides`, an array of 64-bit integer describing the stride of each dimension


#### Examples


```
!cuda_tile.tensor_view<1024x1024xf16, strides=[1024,1]>
!cuda_tile.tensor_view<32x16x32xf16, strides=[512,1,16]>
!cuda_tile.tensor_view<?x?xf16, strides=[?,1]>
!cuda_tile.tensor_view<?x16xf32, strides=[1,?]>
```


### 5.3.3. Subview Types


A tensor view is often too large to be loaded as a single tile for processing. Instead, it is typically first subdivided into smaller tiles. In Tile IR this is expressed using subview types.


Subviews describe a mapping from an index space to a space of statically-sized tiles loaded from a tensor view. They define the necessary index computations performed by a [cuda_tile.load_view_tko](operations.html#op-cuda-tile-load-view-tko) and [cuda_tile.store_view_tko](operations.html#op-cuda-tile-store-view-tko) when accessing elements from a tensor view. A subview’s size is defined by the cardinality of its index space.


Tile IR currently provides a single subview for partitioning a view into a grid of non-overlapping tiles but is designed to support additional subview types in the future that support different indexing patterns. .. .. For later when we bring grid view back. .. .. - partitioning a view into a grid of non-overlapping tiles. .. - partitioning a view into a grid of overlapping tiles.


#### Partition View


`partition_view` is a subview type that represents a view partitioned into a grid of non-overlapping tiles. The index space in this case is the position of the tile in the grid. A tile partition view is specified by providing the size of the loaded tile. Like all tensors, the tile size needs to be a power of two.


Partition views are particularly useful in patterns like matrix multiplication, where a large tensor in global memory is traversed as non-overlapping tiles to form the final result.


The partition view structure is created using the [cuda_tile.make_partition_view](operations.html#op-cuda-tile-make-partition-view) constructor.


It consists of:


 - `tileShape`, the shape of the individual tiles in the view
 - view, the type of the view from which the subview is constructed
 - `dimMap`, an array of 32-bit integers mapping the tiles dimensions to the dimensions of the view.
 - `masked`, a flag defining memory operations outside of the view bounds


These fields are all encoded as part of the type.


Concretely, a tensor view type of `tensor_view<8192x128xf32, strides=[128,1]>` can be partitioned into a grid of `(64x32)` tiles of size `(128x4)` each, which when loaded produce tiles with the type `tile<128x4xf32>`. When loading a tile form such a partition view, the index is the position in the `(64, 32)` grid. Loading element `(4, 2)` hence would return the tile starting at position `(256, 64)` in the underlying view.


Formally, given a tensor view with shape \([S_0, \ldots, S_n]\) and strides \([st_0, \ldots, st_n]\) and a partition view with tile size \([T_0, \ldots, T_n]\), a load or store at position \([I_0, \dots, I_n]\) will load the elements at location

  \[location_{[i_0, \ldots, i_n]} = baseptr + \sum_{m=0}^{n} I_m \cdot ceildiv(S_m, T_m) \cdot st_m\]
Warning


In case where the underlying view’s shape is not divisible by the tile size, tiles on the boundary might be partial. Reading or writing from and to a partial tile is undefined behavior. By specifying the masked qualifier to the partition view, boundaries can optionally be masked. In that case, out of bounds reads return a padding value and corresponding writes are skipped.


##### Examples


```
!cuda_tile.partition_view<
  tile=(2),
  view=!cuda_tile.tensor_view<16xf32, strides=[1]>
>

!cuda_tile.partition_view<
  tile=(2x2),
  view=!cuda_tile.tensor_view<16x16xf32, strides=[16,1]>
>

!cuda_tile.partition_view<
  tile=(2x2),
  view=!cuda_tile.tensor_view<16x16xf32, strides=[16,1]>,
  dim_map=[1, 0]
>

!cuda_tile.partition_view<
  masked tile=(2x2),
  view=!cuda_tile.tensor_view<16x16xf32, strides=[16,1]>,
>
```


## 5.4. Type Equivalence


Tile IR does not provide means to name types. Equivalence of types hence is a purely structural property: Two types are considered equal if they are structurally identical.


Note that some types form a natural subtype relationship. Types with dynamic shapes and strides like view cover the values that an identical type with all dynamic shapes and strides substituted with static values would cover. However, we consider these types distinct in Tile IR.
