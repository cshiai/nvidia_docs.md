# 15.3. __half2_raw


struct __half2_raw
__half2_raw data type
Type allows static initialization of half2 until it becomes a built-in type.

Note: this initialization is as a bit-field representation of half2, and not a conversion from short2 to half2. Such representation will be deprecated in a future version of CUDA.
Note: this is visible to non-nvcc compilers, including C-only compilations
