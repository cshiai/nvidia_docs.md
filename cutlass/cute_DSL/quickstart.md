The CUTLASS DSL 4.4 release currently supports **Linux** and **Python 3.10 - 3.13** only. To install CUTLASS DSLs (limited to CuTe DSL for now), use the following command

## Installation[#](https://docs.nvidia.com/cutlass/latest/media/docs/pythonDSL/quick_start.html#installation "Link to this heading")

Before installing the latest version, you need to uninstall any previous CUTLASS DSL Installation.

pip uninstall nvidia-cutlass-dsl nvidia-cutlass-dsl-libs-base nvidia-cutlass-dsl-libs-cu13 \-y

To ensure compatibility with the examples and code on [GitHub](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass/tree/main), use the [setup.sh](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass/blob/main/python/CuTeDSL/setup.sh) file from the corresponding commit in the repository.

git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass.git

\# For CUDA Toolkit 12.9:
./cutlass/python/CuTeDSL/setup.sh \--cu12

\# For CUDA Toolkit 13.1:
./cutlass/python/CuTeDSL/setup.sh \--cu13

If you just want to try out the last known stable release of the CUTLASS DSL (may not be compatible with the latest examples and code), run:

\# For CUDA Toolkit 12.9:
pip install nvidia-cutlass-dsl

\# For CUDA Toolkit 13.1:
pip install nvidia-cutlass-dsl\[cu13\]

The `nvidia-cutlass-dsl` wheel includes everything needed to generate GPU kernels. It requires the same NVIDIA driver version as the corresponding [CUDA Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-toolkit-release-notes/index.html) (CUDA Toolkit 12.9 or CUDA Toolkit 13.1).

## Recommended Dependencies[#](https://docs.nvidia.com/cutlass/latest/media/docs/pythonDSL/quick_start.html#recommended-dependencies "Link to this heading")

To run examples and begin development, we recommend installing:

pip install torch jupyter

We recommend installing JAX with CUDA support at version 0.8.1 to run JAX examples.

## Recommended Python environment variables for jupyter notebooks[#](https://docs.nvidia.com/cutlass/latest/media/docs/pythonDSL/quick_start.html#recommended-python-environment-variables-for-jupyter-notebooks "Link to this heading")

We recommend setting the following environment variable when running jupyter notebooks.
