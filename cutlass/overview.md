_CUTLASS 4.4.2 - March 2026_

CUTLASS is a collection of abstractions for implementing high-performance matrix-matrix multiplication (GEMM) and related computations at all levels and scales within CUDA. It incorporates strategies for hierarchical decomposition and data movement. CUTLASS decomposes these “moving parts” into reusable, modular software components and abstractions.

Primitives for different levels of a conceptual parallelization hierarchy can be specialized and tuned via custom tiling sizes, data types, and other algorithmic policy. The resulting flexibility simplifies their use as building blocks within custom kernels and applications.

CUTLASS has been providing CUDA C++ template abstractions for high-performance linear algebra since 2017 and these abstractions provide extensive support for a wide range of computations including mixed-precision computations, specialized data-movement (async copy) and multiply-accumulate abstractions for FP64, FP32, TF32, FP16, BF16, [FP32 emulation via tensor core instruction](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass/tree/main/examples/27_ampere_3xtf32_fast_accurate_tensorop_gemm), 8b floating point types (e5m2 and e4m3), block scaled data types (NVIDIA NVFP4 and OCP standard MXFP4, MXFP6, MXFP8), narrow integer types (4 and 8b signed and unsigned integers), and binary 1b data types (where architectures allow for the native support of such data types) across NVIDIA’s Volta, Turing, Ampere, Ada, Hopper, and Blackwell architectures.

To this rich ecosystem of C++ based kernel programming abstractions, CUTLASS 4 adds CUTLASS DSLs. These are Python native interfaces for writing high-performance CUDA kernels based on core CUTLASS and CuTe concepts without any performance compromises. This allows for a much smoother learning curve, orders of magnitude faster compile times, native integration with DL frameworks without writing glue code, and much more intuitive metaprogramming that does not require deep C++ expertise.

Overall we envision CUTLASS DSLs as a family of domain-specific languages (DSLs). With the release of 4.0, we are releasing the first of these in CuTe DSL. This is a low level programming model that is fully consistent with CuTe C++ abstractions — exposing core concepts such as layouts, tensors, hardware atoms, and full control over the hardware thread and data hierarchy.

CuTe DSL demonstrates optimal matrix multiply and other linear algebra operations targeting the programmable, high-throughput _Tensor Cores_ implemented by NVIDIA’s Ampere, Hopper, and Blackwell architectures.

We believe it will become an indispensable tool for students, researchers, and performance engineers alike — flattening the learning curve of GPU programming, rapidly prototyping kernel designs, and bringing optimized solutions into production.

CuTe DSL is currently in public beta and will graduate out of beta by end of summer 2025.

# Performance[#](https://docs.nvidia.com/cutlass/latest/overview.html#performance "Link to this heading")

CUTLASS primitives are very efficient. When used to construct device-wide GEMM kernels, they exhibit nearly optimal utilization of peak theoretical throughput. The figure below shows CUTLASS 3.8’s performance as a % of theoretical peak utilization on various input and output data types when run on NVIDIA Blackwell SM100 architecture GPU.

![ALT](https://docs.nvidia.com/cutlass/latest/_images/cutlass-3.8-blackwell-gemm-peak-performance.svg)

The two figures below show the continual CUTLASS performance improvements on an [NVIDIA H100](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/) (NVIDIA Hopper architecture) since CUTLASS 3.1. CUTLASS 3.5.1 was compiled with the [CUDA 12.5u1 Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads). Tensor Core operations are implemented using CUDA’s [mma](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/index.html#warp-level-matrix-instructions-mma) and [wgmma](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/index.html#asynchronous-warpgroup-level-matrix-instructions) instructions.

# CuTe[#](https://docs.nvidia.com/cutlass/latest/overview.html#cute "Link to this heading")

CUTLASS 3.0 introduced a new core library, CuTe, to describe and manipulate tensors of threads and data. CuTe is a collection of C++ CUDA template abstractions for defining and operating on hierarchically multidimensional layouts of threads and data. CuTe provides `Layout` and `Tensor` objects that compactly package the type, shape, memory space, and layout of data, while performing the complicated indexing for the user. This lets programmers focus on the logical descriptions of their algorithms while CuTe does the mechanical bookkeeping for them. With these tools, we can quickly design, implement, and modify all dense linear algebra operations.

The core abstractions of CuTe are hierarchically multidimensional layouts which can be composed with data arrays to represent tensors. The representation of layouts is powerful enough to represent nearly everything we need to implement efficient dense linear algebra. Layouts can also be combined and manipulated via functional composition, on which we build a large set of common operations such as tiling and partitioning.

CUTLASS 3.0 and beyond adopts CuTe throughout the GEMM hierarchy in its templates. This greatly simplifies the design and improves code composability and readability. More documentation specific to CuTe can be found in its [dedicated documentation directory](https://docs.nvidia.com/cutlass/latest/media/docs/cpp/cute/00_quickstart.html).

## Target Architecture[#](https://docs.nvidia.com/cutlass/latest/overview.html#target-architecture "Link to this heading")

In general, PTX code generated for one target architecture can be run on future architectures (i.e., it is forward compatible). However, CUDA 12.0 introduced the concept of “architecture-accelerated features” whose PTX does not have forward compatibility guarantees. Several Hopper and Blackwell PTX instructions fall under this category of architecture-accelerated features, and thus require a `sm_90a` or `sm100a` target architecture (note the “a” appended). For more details on this and other architecture-accelerated instructions, please refer to the [CUDA Documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#feature-availability).

The target architecture information is passed on to CUTLASS via the cmake flag `CUTLASS_NVCC_ARCHS`. In order to maximize performance on Hopper GH100, users are required to build CUTLASS with `90a` as the target architecture. If a user accidentally builds a kernel which uses SM90a features (e.g. Hopper Tensor Core Instructions), using the SM90 target (note the lack of “a”), with either CUDA Toolkit 12 or 11.8, the kernel is expected to fail with a runtime error.

cmake .. -DCUTLASS\_NVCC\_ARCHS="90a"

Copy to clipboard

Or

cmake .. -DCUTLASS\_NVCC\_ARCHS="100a"

Copy to clipboard

Note: The NVIDIA Blackwell SM100 architecture used in the datacenter products has a different compute capability than the one underpinning NVIDIA Blackwell GeForce RTX 50 series GPUs (SM120). As a result, kernels compiled for Blackwell SM100 architecture with arch conditional features (using `sm100a`) are not compatible with RTX 50 series GPUs.

Please refer to the [functionality documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/cutlass/latest/media/docs/cpp/functionality.html) for details on which kernels require which target architectures.

# Building CUTLASS[#](https://docs.nvidia.com/cutlass/latest/overview.html#building-cutlass "Link to this heading")

CUTLASS is a header-only template library and does not need to be built to be used by other projects. Client applications should target CUTLASS’s `include/` directory in their include paths.

CUTLASS unit tests, examples, and utilities can be build with CMake. The minimum version of CMake is given in the [Quickstart guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/cutlass/latest/media/docs/cpp/quickstart.html). Make sure the `CUDACXX` environment variable points to NVCC in the CUDA Toolkit installed on your system.

$ export CUDACXX\=${CUDA\_INSTALL\_PATH}/bin/nvcc

Copy to clipboard

Create a build directory within the CUTLASS project, then run CMake. By default CUTLASS will build kernels for CUDA architecture versions 5.0, 6.0, 6.1, 7.0, 7.5, 8.0, 8.6, 8.9, and 9.0. To reduce compile time you can specify the architectures to build CUTLASS for by changing the CMake configuration setting `CUTLASS_NVCC_ARCHS`.

$ mkdir build && cd build

$ cmake .. \-DCUTLASS\_NVCC\_ARCHS\=80               \# compiles for NVIDIA's Ampere Architecture

Copy to clipboard

From the `build/` directory, compile and run the CUTLASS unit tests by building the target `test_unit` with make.

The unit tests are organized as several binaries mirroring the top-level namespaces of CUTLASS, and they may be executed in parallel via make’s `-j` command line argument.

$ make test\_unit \-j

CUTLASS is arranged as a header-only library along with Utilities, Tools, Examples, and unit tests. [Doxygen documentation](https://nvidia.github.io/cutlass) provides a complete list of files, classes, and template concepts defined in the CUTLASS project.

A detailed explanation of the source code organization may be found in the [CUTLASS documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/cutlass/latest/media/docs/cpp/code_organization.html), but several main components are summarized below.

### Test[#](https://docs.nvidia.com/cutlass/latest/overview.html#test "Link to this heading")

The `test/unit/` directory consist of unit tests implemented with Google Test that demonstrate basic usage of Core API components and complete tests of the CUTLASS GEMM computations.

Instructions for building and running the Unit tests are described in the [Quickstart guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/cutlass/latest/media/docs/cpp/quickstart.html).

# Performance Profiling[#](https://docs.nvidia.com/cutlass/latest/overview.html#performance-profiling "Link to this heading")

The `tools/profiler/` directory contains a command-line utility for launching each of the GEMM kernels. It can be built as follows:

$ make cutlass\_profiler \-j16

## Building all GEMM and Convolution kernels (_long_ build times)[#](https://docs.nvidia.com/cutlass/latest/overview.html#building-all-gemm-and-convolution-kernels-long-build-times "Link to this heading")

By default, only one tile size is instantiated for each data type, math instruction, and layout. To instantiate all, set the following environment variable when running CMake from an empty `build/` directory. Beware, this results in _tens of thousands_ of kernels and long build times. This would also result in a large binary size and on some platforms linker to fail on building the library. Therefore, it’s highly recommended to generate only a subset of kernels as demonstrated in the sub-section below.

$ cmake .. \-DCUTLASS\_NVCC\_ARCHS\=90a \-DCUTLASS\_LIBRARY\_KERNELS\=all
...
$ make cutlass\_profiler \-j16

## Building a subset of GEMM and Convolution kernels (_reduced_ build times)[#](https://docs.nvidia.com/cutlass/latest/overview.html#building-a-subset-of-gemm-and-convolution-kernels-reduced-build-times "Link to this heading")

To compile strictly one kernel or a small set of kernels, a comma-delimited list of kernel names with wildcard characters may be used to reduce the set of kernels. The following examples show building exactly one or a subset of kernels for NVIDIA Ampere and Turing architecture:

### Building a subset Tensor Core GEMM kernels[#](https://docs.nvidia.com/cutlass/latest/overview.html#building-a-subset-tensor-core-gemm-kernels "Link to this heading")
