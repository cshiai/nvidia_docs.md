## 6.2. Device Management [DEPRECATED]


This section describes the deprecated device management functions of the CUDA runtime application programming interface.


### Functions


__host__
                           ​
                           __device__
                           ​cudaError_t cudaDeviceGetSharedMemConfig (  cudaSharedMemConfig  pConfig )
Returns the shared memory configuration for the current device.

__host__
                           ​cudaError_t cudaDeviceSetSharedMemConfig (  cudaSharedMemConfig config )
Sets the shared memory configuration for the current device.


### Functions


__host__
                              ​
                              __device__
                              ​cudaError_t cudaDeviceGetSharedMemConfig (  cudaSharedMemConfig  pConfig )
Returns the shared memory configuration for the current device.

                                 Parameters



pConfig
- Returned cache configuration

Returns
cudaSuccess, cudaErrorInvalidValue

Deprecated

DescriptionThis function will return in pConfig the current size of shared memory banks on the current device. On devices with configurable shared memory banks, cudaDeviceSetSharedMemConfig can be used to change this setting, so that all subsequent kernel launches will by default use the new bank size. When cudaDeviceGetSharedMemConfig is called on devices without configurable shared memory, it will return the fixed bank size of the hardware.
                              The returned bank configurations can be either:


cudaSharedMemBankSizeFourByte - shared memory bank width is four bytes.

cudaSharedMemBankSizeEightByte - shared memory bank width is eight bytes.

Note:

Note that this function may also return error codes from previous, asynchronous launches.

Note that this function may also return cudaErrorInitializationError, cudaErrorInsufficientDriver or cudaErrorNoDevice if this call tries to initialize internal CUDA RT state.


Note that as specified by cudaStreamAddCallback no CUDA function may be called from callback. cudaErrorNotPermitted may, but is not guaranteed to, be returned as a diagnostic in such case.

__host__
                              ​cudaError_t cudaDeviceSetSharedMemConfig (  cudaSharedMemConfig config )
Sets the shared memory configuration for the current device.

                                 Parameters



config
- Requested cache configuration

Returns
cudaSuccess, cudaErrorInvalidValue

Deprecated

DescriptionOn devices with configurable shared memory banks, this function will set the shared memory bank size which is used for all
                              subsequent kernel launches. Any per-function setting of shared memory set via cudaFuncSetSharedMemConfig will override the device wide setting.
                              Changing the shared memory configuration between launches may introduce a device side synchronization point.
Changing the shared memory bank size will not increase shared memory usage or affect occupancy of kernels, but may have major
                                 effects on performance. Larger bank sizes will allow for greater potential bandwidth to shared memory, but will change what
                                 kinds of accesses to shared memory will result in bank conflicts.

This function will do nothing on devices with fixed shared memory bank size.
The supported bank configurations are:


cudaSharedMemBankSizeDefault: set bank width the device default (currently, four bytes)

cudaSharedMemBankSizeFourByte: set shared memory bank width to be four bytes natively.

cudaSharedMemBankSizeEightByte: set shared memory bank width to be eight bytes natively.

Note:

Note that this function may also return error codes from previous, asynchronous launches.

Note that this function may also return cudaErrorInitializationError, cudaErrorInsufficientDriver or cudaErrorNoDevice if this call tries to initialize internal CUDA RT state.


Note that as specified by cudaStreamAddCallback no CUDA function may be called from callback. cudaErrorNotPermitted may, but is not guaranteed to, be returned as a diagnostic in such case.
